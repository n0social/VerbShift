Task: Build a Chrome Extension Bridge for "Verbshift"

Project Overview

Verbshift is a Next.js web application (currently at https://www.google.com/search?q=verbshift.com) that generates professional guides using AI. The goal is to create a Chrome Extension that allows users to send highlighted text from any website directly into the Verbshift generation engine.

Core Technical Requirements

Manifest V3: Use the latest Chrome Extension standards.

Context Menu Integration: Create a right-click menu option titled "Generate Verbshift Guide" that only appears when text is selected.

Deep Linking: When the menu item is clicked, capture the selected text and open a new tab to https://verbshift.com/generate?content=[ENCODED_TEXT].

Action Icon: Clicking the extension icon in the toolbar should simply open https://verbshift.com in a new tab.

File Structure to Generate

manifest.json: Include permissions for contextMenus and tabs.

background.js: A service worker to handle the onInstalled setup for the context menu and the onClicked listener for the redirection logic.

popup.html: A simple, branded landing page for the extension popup that includes a "Go to Verbshift" button.

Next.js Integration Logic (Instructions for the Web App)

Please also provide the React code snippet (using useSearchParams and useEffect) that needs to be added to the Next.js /generate page to:

Detect the content URL parameter.

Populate the main input field with that content.

(Optional) Automatically trigger the generation function if the parameter is present.

Instructions for Copilot:

"Please generate the complete, production-ready code for the files listed above. Ensure all URL encoding is handled correctly to prevent breaking the URL with special characters from the selected text."
